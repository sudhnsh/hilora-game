## Features  

- **Color-Coded Feedback System**:  
   - **Green**: Correct letter, correct position.  
   - **Red**: Guessed letter is alphabetically *greater* than the correct letter.  
   - **Blue**: Guessed letter is alphabetically *smaller* than the correct letter.  

- **Multiple Game Modes**:  
   - **Classic Mode**: Guess the word in **7 attempts**.  
   - **Journey Mode**: Feedback is provided for **one letter at a time**, progressively revealing clues.  
   - **Rotation Mode**: After each guess, the word shifts using a **Caesar cipher (+1)**, challenging players to adapt as the word changes dynamically.**(If you like challenges, this is the one for you!)**
- **Daily Challenges**: Fresh word challenges are posted automatically every day.  
- **Community Focused**: Designed to run seamlessly on Reddit, encouraging users to play, share, and compete.  
- **Automation with Devvit APIs**: Game management, posts, and feedback responses are automated for smooth functionality.  
- **Open Source**: Contributions and improvements from developers are welcome.  

### Example:  
If the secret word is **‚Äúapple‚Äù**:

**grape** would have the following feedback:  
- **g**: red (since "g" is alphabetically greater than "a")  
- **r**: red (since "r" is alphabetically greater than "p")  
- **a**: blue (since "a" is alphabetically smaller than "p")  
- **p**: blue (since "p" is alphabetically smaller than "l")  
- **e**: green (since "e" is correct and in the right position).
