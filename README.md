# **Hilora: The 5-Letter Guessing Game**

Guess the secret 5-letter word by entering guesses and receiving color-coded feedback. The game uses color cues to help players zero in on the correct word by showing how close their guesses are.

### **Example**:  
If the secret word is **“apple”**:

- **grape**: would have the following feedback:
  - **g**: **red** (since "g" is alphabetically greater than "a").
  - **r**: **red** (since "r" is alphabetically greater than "p").
  - **a**: **blue** (since "a" is alphabetically smaller than "p").
  - **p**: **blue** (since "p" is alphabetically smaller than "l").
  - **e**: **green** (since "e" is correct and in the right position).

**Color Key**:  
- **Green**: Correct letter, correct position.
- **Red**: The guessed letter is alphabetically **greater** than the correct letter.
- **Blue**: The guessed letter is alphabetically **smaller** than the correct letter.
